In a world full of tech tools and apps that simplify our lives, some truly stand out. These gems embody 'Tech That Just Works' and have earned their badges of honor. They empower me and elevate my everyday technical experience.

## Hardware

As of this year, 2024:

- My MacBook Air 13" came early 2015, no seven-year itch, I pray.
- My Logitech M238 Sneaker Head is younger by two years and one battery replacement, yay!
- Samsung Smart Monitor M5 is my extended display and is the youngest at 5 years and still looking great!

## Tools and Apps

- [Brave](https://brave.com) is my favorite chromium-based browser;
- [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com/) is my copy-paste go-to and editor;
- [Bear](https://bear.app) has all of my brain notes and clutter; and,
- [Figma](https://figma.com) is my workflow and process designer.

## Web + Repo

- [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com) built this site;
- [Netlify] (https://netlify.com) powered it; and,
- [GitHub](https://github.io) deployed it.
