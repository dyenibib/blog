*While the tech and design team breathes jargon, I make sure end-users breathe easy.*

Hello, I am Jaja. I lead the Support, QA, and Documentation Team (SQD) at Intelimina Systems, Inc. SQD (sometimes a squid, sometimes a squad) focuses on three key areas.

- **Support**: Delivering quality engagement and training for product and app users
- **QA**: Ensuring exceptional user experience in client-facing applications
- **Documentation**: Creating user-friendly guides and manuals that simplify complex information for diverse audiences

SQD bridges the gap between technical knowledge and user needs, ensuring seamless interaction and support.
